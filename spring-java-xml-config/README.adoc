=== What are the advantages of Java Config? What are the limitations?

**Advantages of Java Config over XML Config:**

- Compile-Time Feedback due to Type-checking
- Refactoring Tools for Java without special support/plugins work out of the box with Java
Config (special support needed for XML Config)

**Advantages of Java Config over Annotation Based Config:**

- Separation of concerns – beans configuration is separated from beans implementation
- Technology agnostic – beans may not depend on concrete IoC/DI implementation – makes it
easier to switch technology
- Ability to integrate Spring with external libraries
- More centralized location of bean list
- Configuration class be final
- Configuration class methods be final

**Limitations of Java Config:**

- All Beans have to be listed, for big applications, it might be a challenge compared to
Component Scanning
