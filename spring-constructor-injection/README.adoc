== What is the behavior of the annotation @Autowired with regards to field injection, constructor injection and method injection?

- If there is one constructor then *@Autowired* annotation is not required. Spring will inject the dependencies in the constructor.
- If there is multiple constructor then *@Autowired* annotation is required to tell Spring which constructor to use to inject the
  dependencies.

By default, all arguments in constructor are required, however you can use Optional, @Nullable or @Autowired(required = false)
to indicate that parameter is not required.

```
  @Autowired
  public SpringBeanD(SpringBeanA springBeanA, SpringBeanB springBeanB,
    @Nullable SampleClassC sampleClassC) {
    this.springBeanA = springBeanA;
    this.springBeanB = springBeanB;
    this.sampleClassC = sampleClassC;
  }
```

```
 @Autowired
  public SpringBeanD(SpringBeanA springBeanA, SpringBeanB springBeanB,
    @Autowired(required = false) SampleClassC sampleClassC) {
    this.springBeanA = springBeanA;
    this.springBeanB = springBeanB;
    this.sampleClassC = sampleClassC;
  }
```

```
  @Autowired
  public SpringBeanD(SpringBeanA springBeanA, SpringBeanB springBeanB,
    Optional<SampleClassC> sampleClassC) {
    this.springBeanA = springBeanA;
    this.springBeanB = springBeanB;
    sampleClassC.ifPresent(sampleClassC1 -> this.sampleClassC = sampleClassC1);
  }
```
