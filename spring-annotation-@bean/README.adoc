=== What does the @Bean annotation do?
 @Bean annotation is used in @Configuration class to inform Spring that instance of class returned by method annotated with @Bean will return bean that will be managed by Spring.

@Bean also allows you to:

- Specify init method – will be called after instance is created and assembled
- Specify destroy method – will be called when bean is discarded (usually when context is
getting closed)
- Specify name for the bean – by default bean has name autogenerated based on method
name, however this can be overridden
- Specify alias/aliases for the bean
- Specify if Bean should be used as candidate for injection into other beans – default true
- Configure Autowiring mode – by name or type (Deprecated since Spring 5.1)
