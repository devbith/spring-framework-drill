=== What is the Template design pattern?

*Template design pattern* is a behavioral design pattern that can be used to encapsulate algorithm/main flow with it steps in a way to achieve steps customization and shared code reusability. It is achieved by creating abstract class that contains algorithm definition/main flow with shared code, and child classes extending abstract class which are customizing step or steps of the algorithm.

Template design pattern can be used to achieve greater code reusability, however since it is using inheritance, which is very strong relationship between classes it can limit future flexibility of the system. You should use this pattern with caution and you should analyze if strategy design pattern will not give you similar results. Strategy uses composition instead of inheritance and in some cases instead of using template method, strategy can be used to achieve code reusability and also code flexibility.
