=== Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)


Aspect oriented programming is a programming paradigm that complements OOP by providing way to separate groups of
cross cutting concerns from business logic code. AOP provides the ability to add additional behavior to the code without
having to modify the business code itself.

*This is achieved by specifying:*
- Location of the code which behavior should be altered - `Point cut is matched with Joint point`
- Code which should be executed that implements cross cutting concern - `Advice`

[NOTE]
====
We should only use AOP when OOP with design pattern and solid concept cannot give a proper solution to
a problem. It is very important not to overuse AOP.

==== Technical words and concepts are important to understand when working with AOP:

- *Joint point*:
A joint point is the specific flow in the program where aspects can "hook in" and modify the behavior of the code.

- *Point cut*:
A pointcut specifies which join points are to be intercepted by an aspect. It defines a set of rules or patterns that match one or more
join points based on their signature, location, or execution context.

- *Advice*:
The code that executes at a join point intercepted by an aspect. There are several types of advice, including before, after, around,
and after throwing.

- *Weaving*:
The process of combining aspects with the base code to create the final executable. Weaving can be done at compile-time,
load-time, or runtime.

- *Proxy*:
A design pattern which intercepts the method invocations and delegates them to an aspects.
